This is the seventh program derived from 100 program suggested by ChatGPT for a 4 week python course. Since I already have programming expertise, I'll be combining the following 3 prompts into a single program. My main goal is to pay close attention to pythonic syntax, creating/updating git repositories, and developing good commenting habits. Upon completing this program, I'll push it to github and request feedback from my peers.

The following 3 ChatGPT prompts were used:
24. Implement a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome.
35. Implement a function that removes duplicate elements from a list while preserving the order.
36. Write a program that counts the frequency of words in a given sentence using a function.
